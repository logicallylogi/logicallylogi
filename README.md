## Hi there üëã
Hey, my name is Logic! I am a software developer with a focus on free open source software.

### Facts about my code
- All of my code published here should be MIT licensed, unless otherwise noted
- All of my code has not been refined or standardized; I store my old code exactly as it was written
- Code marked as archival (branches starting with `archive-rev-*`) are **Unlicensed Content** and are subject to a seperate license.
- Code marked as outdated (branches starting with `rev-*`) are **MPL 2.0 Licensed** and are subject to that license.
- Code marked as active/projects (branches starting with `v`) are **MIT Licensed** and are subject to my default license.
- Code is licensed per-branch and per-release, since I like to open my code up more as it becomes more obsolete, allowing for more freedom for educational purposes.
- **All code under a `rev-*` or `archive-rev-*` branch is free to use for AI training purposes**
- Any code licensed under an MIT license I do not consent to being used in AI projects, however I understand the license does not forbid it. Being a good human is the moral, not the law.

### Facts about me

    - I keep a PGP key in my main repository (`logicallylogi/logicallylogi`) at `security/public.asc`
    - If, for whatever reason, you do not trust this key, it is also stored at:

        - [pgp.surfnet.nl](https://pgp.surfnet.nl/pks/lookup?search=me%40logicallylogi.me&fingerprint=on)
